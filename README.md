The first big problem I faced is I found that hard to use two css libraries, they conflicts each other. 
I tried "Bulma", It makes my logo strenched. After I reseached a lot, I decided to use "Font Awesome".It works well.

Also, pay attention to the css libaray link. Before I copied a link from a tutorial website, but it is a old version,
which could not enable to link with my css style colors, after I changed to the newest version link, it works.

I had this same problem with "Font Awesome", a lot link couldn't work, and finally I got a right link from my friend.

Another trick which makes me headache a long time is that I couldn't make the layout reponsive to different size,
for example, I want desktop each "col" display horizontal, and on phone size to display vertical. I don't know which commander
could make it display this. But the result acctually is quite simple, I just need take off the "raw col-2", the layout became
responsive automatically.
